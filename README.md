# ComPoM
Compositional analysis using poisson-decomposed multinomial models

The models are general and can handle both length (default) and age composition data, as well as arbitrary categorical data such as species composition; by default no assumption is made about ordering or correlations between bins, although these can be explicitly included by linking bins (e.g., length classes) via splines or estimation of between class co-variance matrices.
